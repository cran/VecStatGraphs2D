Description: A 2D statistical analysis is performed, both numerical and graphical, of a set of vectors. Since a vector has two components (module and azimuth) vector analysis is performed in three stages: modules are analyzed by means of linear statistics, azimuths are analyzed by circular statistics, and the joint analysis of modules and azimuths is done using density maps that allow detecting another distribution properties (i.e. anisotropy) and outliers. Tests and circular statistic parameters have associated a full range of graphing: histograms, maps of distributions, point maps, vector maps, density maps, distribution modules and azimuths.
